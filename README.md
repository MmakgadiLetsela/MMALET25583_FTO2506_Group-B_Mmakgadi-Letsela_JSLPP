# JSL Portfolio Piece: Kanban App Deployment & Features Implementation

## Project Overview

This project involves **deploying a Kanban app to Netlify**, ensuring the app's functionality and persistence through local storage, and implementing dynamic features such as task editing, deletion, sidebar interaction, and a theme toggle. The goal is to deliver a fully functional, deployable application that is responsive across devices and maintains data consistency. Students will also focus on **clean, modular code** that is well-documented for future development.
