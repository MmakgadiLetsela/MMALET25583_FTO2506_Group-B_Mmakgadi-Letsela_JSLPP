# JSL Portfolio Piece: Kanban App Deployment & Features Implementation

## Project Overview

This project involves **deploying a Kanban app to Netlify**, ensuring the app's functionality and persistence through local storage, and implementing dynamic features such as task editing, deletion, sidebar interaction, and a theme toggle. The goal is to deliver a fully functional, deployable application that is responsive across devices and maintains data consistency. Students will also focus on **clean, modular code** that is well-documented for future development.

## Technologies used ⚙️
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript

## Feautures Created  ⚒️
- Tasks are fetched from API upon initial load and a loading message is shown. If fetching has failed the user is informed.
- Tasks are saved to localStorage so that they persist on page load.
- Tasks in the modal can be clicked to edit the details and they are then saved to localStorage and displayed.
- Tasks can be deleted and a confrimation message is displayed to the user. Once confirmed, the task is deleted from the board and localStorage.
- A sidebar with details is visible and can be toggled so that it is hidden. A icon appears when it is hidden and can be clicked to view the sidebar again.
- A theme toggle turns the theme from light to dark and is saved so that if loaded, the theme persists.
- The app is mobile responsive, including the interactive sections.


## Set-up Instructions 🚧

## Interaction Instructions 🔭
- Refresh the tab to fetch the initial tasks from the API.
- Click on the "hide sidebar" button to hide the sidebar and click on the googly eyes that appear when you want the sidebar back.
- Click on the sun-and-moon theme toggle to switch between light and dark mode.
- Click on any of the tasks on the board to open a modal that lets you edit any of its details.
- Reload the page to see your changes persist.


## Working Usage Examples 💯
- On initial page load there is a loading message displayed to show that tasks are being fetched from the API.
- If the the app fails to fetch tasks from the API, a message is displayed.
- The sidebar can be hidden by clicking on the "hide sidebar" button. When clicked, the sidebar is hidden and a googly eyes icon is show.
- The theme toggle in the sidebar can be used to toggle between dark mode and light mode. The theme is kept after page load.
- When you click on a task, a modal is opened where details can be edited and updated on the screen.
- If you want to delete a task there is a delete task button on the modal. Clicking it will show a confirmation message. If you click "ok" the task will be deleted from the board and localStorage.
- On mobile view the sidebar panel can be viewed by clicking on the logo in the top-left corner. That opens a menu that has the theme toggle that can also be used to toggle dark/light mode.
- On mobile view the task modal can also be accessed also by clicking on the individual tasks.
