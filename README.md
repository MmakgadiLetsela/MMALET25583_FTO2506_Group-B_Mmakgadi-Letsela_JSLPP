# JSL Portfolio Piece: Kanban App Deployment & Features Implementation

## Project Overview

This project involves **deploying a Kanban app to Netlify**, ensuring the app's functionality and persistence through local storage, and implementing dynamic features such as task editing, deletion, sidebar interaction, and a theme toggle. The goal is to deliver a fully functional, deployable application that is responsive across devices and maintains data consistency. Students will also focus on **clean, modular code** that is well-documented for future development.

## Technologies used ⚙️
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript

## Feautures Created  ⚒️
- Tasks are fetched from API upon initial load and a loading message is shown. If fetching has failed the user is informed.
- Tasks are saved to localStorage so that they persist on page load.
- Tasks in the modal can be clicked to edit the details and they are then saved to localStorage and displayed.
- Tasks can be deleted and a confrimation message is displayed to the user. Once confirmed, the task is deleted from the board and localStorage.
- A sidebar with details is visible and can be toggled so that it is hidden. A icon appears when it is hidden and can be clicked to view the sidebar again.
- A theme toggle turns the theme from light to dark and is saved so that if loaded, the theme persists.
- The app is mobile responsive, including the interactive sections.


## Set-up Instructions
